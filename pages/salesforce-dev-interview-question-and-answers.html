									<h3> Why use triggers in Salesforce? </h3>
									<p> Apex can be invoked by using triggers . Apex triggers enable you to perform custom actions before or after changes to Salesforce records, such as insertions, updates, or deletions. A trigger is Apex code that executes before or after the following types of operations: insert. </p>
									<h3> What programming language is Salesforce written in? </h3>
									<p> Apex is a proprietary programming language provided by the Force.com platform to developers similar to Java and C#. It is a strongly typed, object-oriented, case-insensitive programming language, following a dot-notation and curly-brackets syntax. </p>

									<h3> What are different types of triggers in sfdc? </h3>
									<p> 1.Before Triggers-These triggers are fired before the data is saved into the database.2.After Triggers-These triggers are fired after the data is saved into the database. </p>
									<h3> What are trigger context variables? </h3>
									<p> Trigger.isInsert: Returns true if the trigger was fired due to insert operation.Trigger.isUpdate: Returns true if the trigger was fired due to update operation.</p>
										<p>Trigger.isDelete: Returns true if the trigger was fired due to delete operation.</p>
											<p>Trigger.isBefore: Returns true if the trigger was fired before record is saved.</p>
												<p>Trigger.isAfter: Returns true if the trigger was fired after record is saved.</p>
													<p>Trigger.New: Returns a list of new version of sObject records.</p>

									<h3> What is the difference between Trigger.New and Trigger.NewMap? </h3>
									<p> Trigger.New is Returns a list of new version of sObject records butTrigger.NewMap is Returns a map of new version of sObject records. </p>
									<h3> What is the difference between Trigger.New and Trigger.Old? </h3>
									<p> Trigger.New is Returns a list of new version of sObject records andTrigger.Old is Returns a list of old version of sObject records. </p>
									<h3> Can we call the callouts from trigger? </h3>
									<p> yes we can. It is same as usual class method calling from trigger. The only difference being the method should always be asynchronous with @future</p>
									<h3> What is the recursive trigger? </h3>
									<p> Recursion occurs in trigger if your trigger has a same DML statement and the same dml condition is used in trigger firing condition on the same object(on which trigger has been written). </p>
									<h3> What is the bulkifying triggers? </h3>
									<p> By default every trigger is a bulk trigger which is used to process the multiple records at a time as a batch. For each batch of 200 records. </p>
									<h3> What is the use of future methods in triggers? </h3>
									<p> Using @Future annotation we can convert the Trigger into a Asynchronous Class and we can use a Callout method. </p>
									<h3> What is the order of executing the trigger apex? </h3>
									<p> 1. Executes all before triggers.</p> 
									<p>	2. Validation rules.</p>
									<p>	3. Executes all after triggers.</p>
									<p>	4. Executes assignment rules.</p>
									<p>	5. Executes auto-response rules.</p>
									<p>	6. Executes workflow rules.</p>
									<p>	7. If there are workflow field updates, updates the record again.</p>
									<p>	8. If the record was updated with workflow field updates, fires before and after triggers one more time. Custom validation rules are not run again.</p>
									<p>	9. Executes escalation rules.</p>
									<p>	10. If the record contains a roll-up summary field or is part of a cross-object workflow, performs calculations and updates the roll-up summary field in the parent record. Parent record goes through save procedure.</p>
									<p>	11. If the parent record is updated, and a grand-parent record contains a roll-up summary field or is part of a cross-object workflow, performs calculations and updates the roll-up summary field in the parent record. Grand-parent record goes through save procedure.</p>
									<p>	12. Executes Criteria Based Sharing evaluation.</p>
									<p>	13. Commits all DML operations to the database.</p>
								<p>14. Executes post-commit logic. Ex: Sending email. </p>
									<h3> How do we avoid recursive triggers? </h3>
									<p> Use a static variable in an Apex class to avoid an infinite loop. Static variables are local to the context of a Web request. </p>
									<h3> How many triggers we can define on a object? </h3>
									<p> We can write more than one trigger But it is not recommended .Best practice is One trigger On One object. </p>
									<h3> What are the soql limitations in apex? </h3>
									<p> Total number of records retrieved by SOQL queries-50,000.</p>
									<h3> What are the transaction limitations in apex? </h3>
									<p> Each execution of a batch Apex job is considered a discrete transaction.
									For example, a batch Apex job that contains 1,000 records and is executed without the optional scope parameter from Database.executeBatch is considered five transactions of 200 records each.
									The Apex governor limits are reset for each transaction.
									If the first transaction succeeds but the second fails, the database updates made in the first transaction are not rolled back. </p>
									<h3> What is the need of batch apex? </h3>
									<p> By using Batch apex classes we can process the records in batches in asynchronously. </p>
									<h3> What is Database.Batchable interface? </h3>
									<p> The class that implements this interface can be executed as a batch Apex job. </p>
									<h3> Define the methods in batchable interface? </h3>
									<p> Start:</p>
									<code>
									global Database.Querylocator start (Database.BatchableContext bc){}
								   </code>
									<p>Execute:</p>
									<code>global void execute(Database.BatchableContext bc,List){}</code>
									<p>Finish:</p>
								<code>	global void finish(Database.BatchableContext bc) {}</code>
									<h3> What is purpose of start method in batch apex? </h3>
									<p> It collect the records or objects to be passed to the interface method execute. </p>
									<h3> What is the Database.QueryLocator? </h3>
									<p> If we use a Database.QueryLocator,the governor limit for the total number of records retrieved by SOQL queries is bypassed. (Default 50,000 It allow up to 50 million records). </p>
									<h3> What is the iterable<Sobject>?</h3>
									<p> If you use an iterable,the governor limit for the total number of records retrieved by SOQL queries is still enforced. </p>
									<h3> What is the use of execute method? </h3>
									<p> Contains or calls the main execution logic for the batch job. </p>
									<h3> How many times execute method is called? </h3>
									<p> Execute method is called for each batch of records. </p>
									<h3> What is the scope of execute method? </h3>
									<p> The maximum value for the optional scope parameter is 2,000</p>
									<h3> Can we call callouts from batch apex? </h3>
									<p> Yes we can call. </p>
									<h3> Can we call another batch apex from batch apex? </h3>
									<p> Yes you can call a batch apex from another batch apex .Either in start method or in finish method you can call other batch. </p>
									<h3> How many callouts we can call in batch apex? </h3>
									<p> Batch executions are limited to one callout per execution. </p>
									<h3> Batch is synchronous or Asynchronous operations? </h3>
									<p> Asynchronous operations. </p>
									<h3> What is the default size of the batch ? </h3>
									<p> The default batch size is 200 records. </p>
									<h3> What is the Database.BatchableContext? </h3>
									<p> BatchableContext Interface is Represents the parameter type of a batch job method and contains the batch job ID. This interface is implemented internally by Apex. </p>
									<h3> How to track the details of the current running Batch using BatchableContext? </h3>
									<p> You can check the AsyncApexJob.Status using the JobId from the Database.BatchableContext. </p>
									<h3> How many batch jobs can be added to queue? </h3>
									<p> Queued counts toward the limit of 5. </p>
									<h3> What is Database.State full interface? </h3>
									<p> To maintain variable value inside the Batch class, Database.Stateful is used. </p>
									<h3> What is Database.AllowCallouts? </h3>
									<p> To use a callout in batch Apex, you must specify Database.AllowsCallouts in the class definition. For example:
									global class SearchAndReplace implements Database.Batchable<sObject>,
									Database.AllowsCallouts{
									//Business logic you want by implementing Batchable interface methods
									}
									Callouts include HTTP requests as well as methods defined with the webService keyword. </p>
									<h3> What is AsyncApexJob object? </h3>
									<p> AsyncApexJob is Represents an individual Apex sharing recalculation job.Use this object to query Apex batch jobs in your organization. </p>
									<h3> When a Batch Apex worker record is created? </h3>
									<p> For each 10,000 AsyncApexJob records, Apex creates one additional AsyncApexJob record of type BatchApexWorker for internal use. </p>
